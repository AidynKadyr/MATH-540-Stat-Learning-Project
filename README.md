# The impact of replacing Euler's constant in Sigmoid function for Logistic Regression.
Euler's constant was replaced by other combinations and the impact on the model performance was monitored for the Breast Cancer dataset.
As a result, the experiment is equivalent to feature scaling and Euler's constant was chosen for logistic regression for convenience reasons.
